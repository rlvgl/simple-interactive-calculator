# simple-interactive-calculator
This is a simple 4 function calculator that takes 2 values and can take number input using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This simple website uses: 
1) Minimal HTML for Structure
2) Responsive CSS Grid for Layout
3) Vanilla JavaScript for Logic and Interactivity

I made the ability to type multiple numbers using the following logic:
value = value*10 + valueToAdd

This makes the current number increase by 10 and adds the next number clicked to the end of the number
